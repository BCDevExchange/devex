  <div class="alert alert-info">For now, I believe the only thing we need messages to be generated for are for invitations to join a company. We should make the messages simple and actionable from the list view (so the user doesn't need to click into a detail view of the message).</div>

  <div class="alert alert-info">After the user clicks one of the action buttons in the message, the message disappears and is replaced with one of these confirmation messages. Ideally, the confirmation message would display for approx. 6 seconds, then disappear on its own.  If that's not easy to do in this space, then we could make the user manually dismiss the message, as illustrated below by the 'Dismiss' link.</div>

  <!-- Body after message has been actioned -->
