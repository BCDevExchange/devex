          <h4>3. Submit a Proposal</h4>
          <p>Once youâ€™ve qualified, find an opportunity you want to bid on and submit a proposal:

        <h2>What happens after you respond to the Request for Proposals</h2>
        <p>Here's what happens after you submit your proposal through the website.</p>
        
        <h4>Code Challenge</h4>
        <p>Depending on your proposal score, your team may be screened in for a Code Challenge. Either way, you'll be notified promptly whether your team is in the running.</p>
        <p>A maximum of 4 teams will move to the Code Challenge.</p>
        <p>Teams will be given 5 (five) business days to complete the Code Challenge in GitHub.
        The challenge will be evaluated by two independent evaluators and a static code evaluator. Those who complete the Code Challenge and meet the evaluation requirements will then proceed to the Team Scenario.</p>

        <h4>Team Scenario</h4>
        <p>Teams that successfully complete the Code Challenge will be invited to participate in a 3-hour Team Scenario.</p>
        <p>At the start of the meeting, your team will be presented with a scenario where they can demonstrate their capabilities and how they work as a team under pressure. This will be followed by questions of your team from the evaluation panel, including follow up questions on both the scenario and coding challenge.</p>
        <p>Your entire team should participate in the Team Scenario. This can be arranged either in person or by video conference.</p>

        <h4>Contract</h4>
        <p>The scores for all phases will be totalled and the highest scoring team will be awarded the contract.</p>
