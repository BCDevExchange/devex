        <p class="subtitle">'Sprint With Us' is is a new way for government to contract for Agile software development teams:</p>
        <div class="well">
          <h4>Agile</h4>
          <p>Teams will be adaptable to change and follow the Agile Scrum process, building and validating features iteratively with users.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Interdisciplinary Teams</h4>
          <p>Teams will be a maximum of nine people and possess skills such as scrum master, software development, continuous delivery, and UI/UX design and research.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Agile Phases</h4>
          <p>Don’t expect lengthy requirements. This is Agile. Teams will start with Inception to understand the business problem. Next they will build a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the feasibility of their solution. Finally, they will build out the rest of the product in Implementation.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Open Source</h4>
          <p>Code produced will be owned by the contracted team, but published in GitHub under an open source license.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Government Product Owners</h4>
          <p>Teams will work closely with a trained government product owner with the expertise and the responsibility to run the service.</p>
